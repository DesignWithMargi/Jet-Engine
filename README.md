Jet-Engine
# ✈️ Jet Engine 3D Concept Model

## 📖 Project Overview
*I designed and modeled this jet engine 3D concept completely in SOLIDWORKS as part of my mechanical design and CAD learning journey.*

The entire model was created **from scratch** using feature-based modeling techniques. My primary focus was on:
* **Geometry & Structure:** Understanding how different components of a jet engine are arranged and interact.
* **Design Intent:** Ensuring the model is editable and logically structured.
* **CAD Workflow:** Strengthening my skills in parametric modeling and assembly management.

This project was a valuable hands-on experience that enhanced both my technical knowledge and design thinking.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
To achieve the final assembly, I utilized various feature-based operations including:
* **Revolved Boss/Base:** Used for the primary shaft and casing components to ensure cylindrical symmetry.
* **Lofted Features:** Applied to create complex aerodynamic shapes for the intake and exhaust.
* **Shell & Cut-Extrude:** Used to create internal cavities and precise housing details.
* **Standard Mates:** Applied concentric and coincident mates to assemble the turbine stages and ensure proper alignment.

## ⚙️ Challenges & Learning Outcomes
Building a complex assembly like this presented several challenges:
1.  **Complex Geometry:** Managing the curvature of the turbine blades required precise sketching and plane creation.
2.  **Assembly Management:** Organizing the feature tree and ensuring mates did not conflict as the assembly grew in size.
3.  **Optimization:** Balancing visual detail with software performance.


## 🚀 Future Scope
I am continuously working on improving my CAD skills. Future updates to this project may include:
* Applying photo-realistic rendering using SolidWorks Visualize.
* Conducting Flow Simulation (CFD) to analyze air intake.
* Creating detailed 2D manufacturing drawings.
